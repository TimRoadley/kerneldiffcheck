Virtual Framebuffer driver:

This is a basic driver which allows the user to create N virtual framebuffers.
These framebuffers are no more than contiguous physical memory regions that
are wrapped by the standard framebuffer device interface.  

Building the kernel module:
In virtual_fb source directory: 
  make -C <path to kernel sources>  M=`pwd`

Use:
The kernel module takes a single argument vfbcount which is an integer
number of virtual framebuffers which will be created. The default size of the
framebuffers is 128x128 16bpp, but this can be reconfigured using fbset after
the module is loaded.
